I have added the following functions to my Minima GitHub Repository:

    o Tuning by 2500Hz Steps (mode set via button 7)
    o Re-Center Tuning Knob while any button is pressed, without changing the Freq

    See: https://github.com/wa0uwh/radiono_erb

I now have working, but not officially published:

    o RIT is working (but very little testing)
    o Limit TX to within the Ham Bands

    See: https://github.com/wa0uwh/radiono_erb/tree/Experimental

The above new functions are added to the current list:

    o High resolution, plus/minus 1Hz Tuning (thanks to Jeff - KO7M).
    o Near Normal Dial Tuning Method as found on most Dial Radio system.
    o Tuning Cursor positioning via Left/Right push buttons.
    o Automatic (original) or Manual Selection of Sideband via push button.
    o Ham Band Switching via Up and Down push buttons
    o Nine Ham Band Memories, with Frequency and Sideband Saved
    o RF386 Power Amplifier Filter Selection via generated clock pulses (Note: Not a lot of testing has been done on this yet)
